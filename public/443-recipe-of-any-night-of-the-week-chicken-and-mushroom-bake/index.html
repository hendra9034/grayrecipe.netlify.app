<h5 id="steps-to-make-chicken-and-mushroom-bake">Steps to make Chicken And Mushroom Bake:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Preheat the oven to 180 (fan). As that heats prepare the filling by adding the 1/2 tbsp cooking oil to a medium to large saucepan. Add in the red onion and mushrooms. Gently fry over a medium heat for a few minutes. Season well with salt and pepper. Add in the chicken and stir. Cook until the chicken is browned off.</li>
<li>In another saucepan over a medium heat add the butter and once melted add the flour and stir into a paste. Add the milk little by little whilst whisking until a creamy smooth white sauce forms. It needs to be thick enough to coat the back of a spoon. Season with salt and pepper. Add the herbs, garlic and stock in with the chicken. Stir to combine. Next add in the sugar and then remove from the heat. Allow to cool for around two minutes then add the white sauce and mustard. Stir it through well.</li>
<li>Pour into a oven proof dish (I used a round ceramic pie dish). Layer over the potatoes neatly until completely covered. Spray over some cooking oil. Bake on a baking tray, in case of spills for 60 minutes until the potatoes are almost cooked through. Remove from the oven and grate over some quality Parmigianino Reggiano. Bake for a further 10-15 minutes or until the potatoes are completely cooked. Serve up and enjoy! :)</li>
