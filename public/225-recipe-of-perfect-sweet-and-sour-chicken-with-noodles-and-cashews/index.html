<li>This dish is all about the Prep. Get your ingredients organised and you'll be ready to Wok!</li>
<li>Take a bowl and a good pair of kitchen scissors and cut up the Chicken Fillet in to 2-3 cm chunks.</li>
<li>Now Dice up the Pineapple and put in to a bowl until ready to use. I use around 1/4 to 1/3 per person depending on the size of the fruit.</li>
<li>Peel and thinly slice the Carrots, no thicker than 2mm and put in to a jug with Boiling Water to soften slightly.</li>
<li>Slice the Pepper lengthways, removing the seeds and put in to another bowl with the Green Beans, as they will have the same cooking time.</li>
<li>To make the Sauce, in a bowl, mix together the Cornflour and Cold Water until smooth and then simply add all of the other Ingredients and stir until combined. This should be a pink/orange colour!</li>
<li>Lastly, cut the Red Onion in to Wedges, thinly slice the Chilli and Garlic and slice the Ginger lengthways in to 1mm thick pieces&hellip;. Now we're ready to Wok!</li>
<li>Add 2 tbsp of Olive Oil to your Wok and 1 tbsp to a non stick frying pan, turning both on to a medium/high heat.</li>
<li>Add the Cashews to the Frying Pan and once the Oil in the Wok is hot, add the Chicken.</li>
<li>After 2-3 minutes, once the Chicken is sealed, throw in the Onion, Garlic, Chilli and Ginger and stir in to the Chicken. Now drain the Carrots and add to wok.</li>
<li>After another couple of minutes add the Pineapple, Pepper and Green Beans.</li>
<li>By now your Cashews should have begun to take on some colour&hellip; Keep your eye on them, making sure they don't burn, stirring and taking off heat if necessary.</li>
<li>Empty your bowl of Sauce in to the Wok and stir so that all the Ingredients are coated.</li>
<li>Cook for around 5 minutes, adding a splash of water as Sauce thickens.</li>
<li>Whilst the Sauce cooks and thickens add your Noodles to the Cashews and stir fry for 2-3 minutes, adding a splash of water, until cooked.</li>
