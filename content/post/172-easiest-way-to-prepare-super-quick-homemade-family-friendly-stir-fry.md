recipeingredient:
- " brown basmati rice"
- " sesame oil"
- " spring onions finely chopped"
- " cube of fresh ginger peeled and finely chopped or grated frozen is also good as it is chopped already"
- " garlic peeled and finely chopped"
- " red chilli finely chopped optional"

- " unsalted cashews"
- " soy sauce plenty of it I use about 34 tbsps  kikkomen is our fave"
- " mirin"
- " sweet chilli sauce"
- " large chicken breasts cut into chunks"
recipeinstructions:
- "If you have time (and remember to do it!) marinade the chicken chunks in extra soy sauce. Cover and put in the fridge for an hour or so (sometimes I marinade mine just while I&#39;m preparing all the veg if I&#39;ve forgotten to do it in advance!)"
- "Place the rice in a pan with 3 cups of boiling water. Bring to the boil and then reduce heat to a simmer. Put the lid on and cook for approx. 15 - 20 mins depending on the cooking instructions on the packet. I tend to take the lid off 5 mins before the end of cooking. When nearly all the water is absorbed into the rice, I place the lid back on and remove from the heat and let it steam for a few minutes."
- "Whilst the rice is cooking, heat the sesame oil in a large non-stick frying pan or wok. Add the spring onions, garlic and ginger (and chilli if using) and fry for a few minutes, stirring every now and again."
- "Add the chicken pieces and stir until coated in the oil. Cook on a medium heat with the lid on for approx 10 minutes, making sure the chicken is cooked all the way through (you will need to adjust your cooking time depending on how small or large you chunks are!)"
- "Once the chicken is cooked, add all your chopped veg and heat on a medium-high heat, stirring and tossing your veg continuously. Add your soy sauce, mirin and sweet chilli sauce and make sure all the veg is coated. You may need to add a little more soy sauce. Cook your veg for approx 5 mins."
- "Once your veg are just cooked through (you want them to be on the crunchy side rather than floppy and too soft), add your cashew nuts and stir in for a minute or so."
- "Once your rice is cooked, add it to your pan with the veg and chicken and mix together. If you prefer not to add rice you could use noodles, or just use more veg and cut the carbs out completely."
- "Serve in warm bowls and eat with chopsticks."
