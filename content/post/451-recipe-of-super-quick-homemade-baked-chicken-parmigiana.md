recipeingredient:
- " Chicken"
- "2 large chicken breasts"
- "2 eggs"
- "1/2 cup cornflour"
- "1 cup panko"
- "1 tbsp olive oil"
- "to taste Salt and black pepper"

- "3 cloves garlic crushed"
- "2 bay leaves"
- "to taste Salt and black pepper"
- " To serve"
- "100 g grated mozzarella cheese"
- "300 g rotini pasta"
recipeinstructions:
- "Prep the chicken by covering with cling film and firmly pounding until about 10mm thick. Season both sides with salt and fresh ground pepper"
- "Whisk up the eggs in a bowl, and lay out the cornflour and panko in 2 separate dishes as shown here"
- "Now, take each chicken breast and coat with cornflour, then dip in the eggs, then the panko. The flour and eggs act as the glue for the panko, so get them well covered!"

- "Next, get the oven preheating to 190C, then place the chicken breasts in an oven dish. Cover the chicken with the tomato sauce from the other pan, then generously sprinkle with cheese before putting in the preheated oven for 15-20 mins"
- "While the parmigiana is baking cook up some of your favourite pasta in a pot of boiling water for 7 mins - I used rotini this time since I had some to hand - and serve once the chicken is nice and golden brown"
