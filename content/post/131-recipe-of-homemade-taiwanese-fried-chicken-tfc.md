- "When the oil is hot enough (between 160-180 degrees), tip: place the end of the chopstick into the oil, if it bubbles the oil is ready.

- "Once all of the chicken has been cooked, transfer to a large mixing bowl. Then going back to the oil place in handful fresh basil leaves. Tip: Be careful as the oil will splatter if basil leaves have any extra moisture of water in it and may make a popping sound. The basil leaves cook quite fast, so you only need to fry them for a few seconds. Remove once crispy. Place basil leaves on baking tray lined with a paper towel to remove excess oil."
- "Now go back to the chicken and add the crispy basil leaves. Now dust generously with the Taiwanese pepper salt. Shake the bowl and toss the chicken gently to coat every piece of it. Serve immediately while pipping hot. Eat it as a snack or as a side dish accompaniment with other dishes."
