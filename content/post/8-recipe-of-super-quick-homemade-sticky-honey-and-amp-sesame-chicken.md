Fry for a minute until fragrant then add in the sauce. Cook the sauce for a few seconds until it thickens then add a small dash of water to loosen it up. Give it a good stir. Turn down the heat and bring the sauce to a simmer. Allow the sauce to reduce down by half and thicken."
- "Add in the chicken pieces. Toss the chicken in the sauce quickly until evenly coated. Sprinkle over some sesame seeds and toss the chicken again to distribute. Sprinkle over more sesame seeds then serve up and garnish with the sliced spring onion greens. Enjoy with your choice of side(s). :)"
