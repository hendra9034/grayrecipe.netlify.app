recipeingredient:
- "3 - 4 chicken breasts"
- "1 tsp garlic powder"
- "1 tsp salt"
- "1/2 tsp pepper ground"
- "3/4 cup cornflakes"
- "1/4 cup parmesan cheese grated"
recipeinstructions:
- "I first began by mincing the chicken breasts in a food processor. I know you can buy store bought chicken mince, but I wanted to make my own as I will know it will only have chicken and not anything else in it!"
- "Once you have chicken mince, add the garlic powder, salt and ground pepper."
- "I powdered the cornflakes in my spice grinder to a coarse powder. Grate the parmesan (I like mine freshly grated but store bought grated parmesan is ok too). Mix the ground cornflakes and grated parmesan cheese together in a bowl."
- "With wet hands, roll and flatten out the chicken mixture into nugget patties."
- "Then roll the nuggets into the cheese-cornflake mix."
- "When I made these, I lined them up on a baking sheet and stuck it in the freezer for a couple of hours. Once they hardened up, I transferred them all into a ziploc bag and put it back in the freezer."
- "When you are ready to bake these little treats, preheat the oven to 200C."
- "Bake them until cooked through. The outer crumb part will get a nice cooked through color / look to it. It took me about 15mins. The nuggets puffed up a bit too for me when they were cooked through. Do keep an eye on the nuggets as you don&#39;t want it to over cook cause the chicken meat will dry up when you cook it too much."
- "Transfer to a serving platter, squeeze some tomato sauce next to it and serve immediately."
